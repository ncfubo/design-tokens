# Figma Tokens to Style Dictionary

Design tokens are generated and modified in the Figma Tokens plugin: https://docs.tokens.studio/

Updates trigger a git push which then runs this script to prep them for the style dictionary: https://www.npmjs.com/package/token-transformer.  

The tokens are then run through the style dictionary and updated in the build folder.
